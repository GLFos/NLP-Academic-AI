# NLP-Academic-AI

This project, the Reliable Education Companion (REC), is meant to provide students of all levels with an advantage in academic research. 
There are a number of implemented and planned features for this application, and I will quickly go over them.



**Implemented:**
A text summarizer with the goal of quickly decerning if an academic paper fits the criteria for one's research by looking at the abstract. This can also be used on articles.

Reading difficulty sensor that determines the level of complexity that a given document or article has. This is more useful for lower-level scholars, as college and advanced degree students are expected to tackle
more complex papers. 

Citation generation for quick, easy citations in both MLA and APA formats. The user is prompted for each section of a citation, which is then formatted correctly and given in the desired style. 



**Planned:**
Automatic citation for with the use of links. This will come as we expand more into HTML integration.

Summarizing highlighted sections of an article or document.

Assistance with conclusions or abstracts

How many citations are within a given document and how many times a document has been cited in different works.

Excel compatability for summaries and organization of research.

Pinpointing keywords throughout a document to nail central themes.

Contextual critcism. This is the most complex, but the most exciting aspect of the project. The goal is to be able to pinpoint other cited works within a document (especially historical ones) and provide deeper
context through dates, country of origin, authorship, and ideologies. We hope to bring new insights through research that is openly accessible. 


**Apache Solr**
Another separate section of this project that will be integrated later is the use of a custom search engine. Thanks to Apache Solr, we are currently storing many different academic papers with the use of the 
OpenAlex API. We hope to use this in tandem with REC to provide a simple way to research all of academia.
